# My DevOps Playground - Big Platform

I will build a platform with:
- A Login Service (for people to log in)
- A Product Service (to show things people can buy)
- An Order Service (to let people buy stuff)

These services will live in containers.
They will talk to each other over a network.
I will run them in the cloud using AWS.
